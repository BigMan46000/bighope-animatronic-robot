# BigHope Animatronic Robot Project

This is the official repository for the **BigHope Animatronic Robot** ‚Äî an educational robotics system that combines 3D printing, servo mechanics, AI/ML interaction, and omni-wheel mobility. Designed for STEAM learning, this project introduces students to the world of embedded systems, machine learning, and mechanical engineering through hands-on experience.

## üîß Project Overview

This project begins with a servo-controlled animatronic eye using the **Arduino Portenta H7** and **Nano 33 BLE Sense**. It expands to include:
- A robotic neck (base, elbow, wrist)
- Omni-directional mobility using DC motors + omni wheels
- AI-powered behavior triggered by gesture, sound, or environmental input

---

## ‚ú® Features

- 3D-printed eye with pan, tilt, and blinking eyelids
- Nano 33 BLE Sense for gesture, sound, and ML input
- Portenta H7 for servo control and real-time responsiveness
- Optional PCA9685 for additional servo expansion
- AI/ML model integration (TinyML - gestures, keyword spotting)
- Holonomic drive control using omni wheels and DC motors
- Modular sprint-based development process (documented in Notion)
